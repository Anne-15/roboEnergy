    <h2>Background</h2>
    In the year 1999, i was born of a humble family of two children;

      <li>son</li>
      <li>daughter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Education</h2>
  <p>
    I completed my primary year in 2013 and got an invitation to a national school;<strong>The Moi Forces Academy-Lanet.</strong>After a successful four-year course, i managed to complete my high school year in 2017. Despite the many challenges in our country that year, I managed to secuure a place at the university.

    <h2>Career Development</h2>
    <p>
      My Career development is at a start with coding and programming as a foundation for my Computer Engineering course. Moringa School offers skills that enhances understanding to the computer world. Personally it is enjoyable but nothing good comes without it's challanges. Every step is a stepping stone and comes along with it's challanges. For me, it's quite challanging to co-operate with new faces and the content at times is confusing at times but with time it clears and like a race you move back to the line and eventually win the race.
    </p>
    <h2>Job Experience</h2>
    <p>My job experience level is at a foundation because am still on a journey in career development.</p>
    <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
    <p>My personal interests are unique and open-source to everyone. I like spending time with myself rather than with firends and am not of a party hollic like most of my age mates are. 'Silent Killer' was my nickname in Primary because I am more of a thinker than a talker. I see some things with the 'third eye'. I like listening to music according to the current mood. Example; A relaxed mood I can listen to house and a Hype mood I can listen to electronic or hiphop music. To anything boring high chances are sleep. Boring talks, speeches, parties, dinner and meetings, sleep is my number one priority.<em>I value my sleep.</em> I am enticed with beautiful things and apealing to the eye.</p>
